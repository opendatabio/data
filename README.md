# data

Data sets for use in OpenDataBio installation. The datasets are created using the `mkdata.sh` shell script, and may be loaded into an OpenDataBio
installation using the `php install` command. The `seeds.json` file controls which seed file should be used for each OpenDataBio version 
(greater than 0.7.5, which is the first version to import seeds).
